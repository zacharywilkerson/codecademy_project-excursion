# Codecademy: Excursion
## Off-Platform Project

This project was designed to create a landing page which advertises a mobile app called â€œExcursion" which helps users record and share their outdoor adventures. 

My site for Excursion ([live](https://zacharywilkerson.github.io/codecademy_project-excursion/)) is available through Github Pages. Feel free to have a look (preview below)!
